Update to TTT
    - Orchestrators
        - They are not allowed to udpate context directly
        - They are only allowed to fire actions for other orchestrators or resolvers
        - Usually tied to higher-level actions
    - Resolvers
        - Can directly update the part of the context they own
        - That's all they're aware of
        - Any other needed part of the context must be passed in as part of the action payload
        - Always undoable?
        - No randomness
        - Usually tied to concrete components/subState

How do orchestrators call resolvers? Through gameContext.getResolver? Passing in only part of context that the resolver is aware of?
